# Shape recognition with neural network
In this section, two geometric shape recognition projects have been implemented.<br />The main goal is to recognize 3 shapes: circle, rectangle, triangle.<br />
• Prefix to postfix<br />
 • Prefix to infix<br />
 • Postfix to prefix<br />
 • Postfix to infix<br />
 • Infix to prefix<br />
 • Infix to postfix<br />

# Description of the first project
### I will upload soon.
In the first project, we have one of 3 shapes in each image: circle, rectangle and triangle. In this project, we have 2000 photos of 100 x 100 black and white pixels per class. (6000 photos in total)


# Description of the second project
In the second project, I implemented 19 classes, so that in each photo there are: one shape, two shapes, or three shapes. (In total, we have 38000 photos in this data set) . In this project, the network performed and learned with 30 epochs and 720 iterations in each epoch. The accuracy of the network on the test dataset was about 96.76%. The graphs of accuracy according to each epoch are placed in the result file.
