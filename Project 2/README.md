# Description of the project
In this part, I implemented the classes based on the possible permutations that have a maximum of 3 shapes in one photo. In the zip file, I put the data in two folders, one for testing and the other for learning. I put one data sample from each class in the "dataset examples" folder.
# Description of the dataset
In this dataset, the classes are divided based on the number of objects. The letter R stands for rectangle, T stands for triangle, and C stands for circle. In the classes, these abbreviations are used to identify the photo model and the type of objects, for example, class number 6 includes a circle and a rectangle.
