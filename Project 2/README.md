# Description of the project
In this part, I implemented the classes based on the possible permutations that have a maximum of 3 shapes in one photo. In the zip file, I put the data in two folders, one for testing and the other for learning. I put one data sample from each class in the "dataset examples" folder.
# Description of the dataset
In this dataset, the classes are divided based on the number of objects. The letter R stands for rectangle, T stands for triangle, and C stands for circle. In the classes, these abbreviations are used to identify the photo model and the type of objects, for example, class number 6 includes a circle and a rectangle.
# Description of the CODE
In this project, we modeled the neural network using Tensorflow and keras library. We used GPU hardware to train the network. We entered the data into the network with a batch size of 32 and the network was learned in 30 epochs or in other words with 22,800 iterations. The accuracy of the network for the test data was about 96.76%. In the result folder, there are some graphs of the network status.
